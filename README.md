If you would like to use these files as well, be my guest. These will accompany what I teach my friends,
but aren't the only things being used.

### About Contributions

I am open to the idea, but I really am not trying to upkeep this repository super seriously and what not.

But if you wish, go ahead and do a Pull Request and let that stuff fill up and not get checked ever.
